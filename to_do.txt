This is a to-do list to bring all of our packages up to the open standards 
that a Debian based distro is expected to have. This document can be freely
deleted when it is no longer useful.

All packages must be open-source and signed
	1. 	open source means all source must be available somewhere, I recomend 
		github. My recomendation is than ALL packages have a seperate repo on 
		on github. Then the actual .deb's can be amassed into a repository.
		a.	This means that the PRE dpkg-buildpackage source be uploaded into 
			a seperate repo. 
		B.	The perfect example of this is: 
			https://github.com/super-nathan/wumpus-monster
			on any Debian system you can clone into the github repo and build this
			package from source with `dpkg-buildpackage` and then use `dpkg -i` 
			to install the package. This is the Debian way.
		c.	I am not saying this is the "right" way, bit it IS
			the right way for a Debian based distro. 
		d. 	A more elegant example is: https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm
			which includes in the "distros" folder all that is needed to build
			debian packages from source. PiBang uses this EXACT source to build
			spacefm for distribution, except that I audit the code and sign it.
	2. Which bring me to signing it. I have a closely guarded package called 
		pibang-keyring that installs my PERSONAL gpg public key as an authorized
		key on all pibang systems. Without access to my build server AND my 
		password you CANNOT build a package that is installable without a scary 
		warning. If I had more devs I would add their personal GPG keys to the 
		keyring and give them upload access. Alternativly I could take their source, 
		build it, and then sign it. Either way. There MUST be a signed key and 
		signed packages. non-negotiable.

			b.	https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging
			c.	http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~lockhart/gpg/gpg-cs.html
	3.	We need a web accessable repo and that can easily be done using rsync 
		reprepro http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/
